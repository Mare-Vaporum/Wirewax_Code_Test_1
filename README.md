# WIREWAX Code Test 1
You’re going to be creating a tag similar to the ones we use in both our commercial projects and the ones
available through our free studio tool. Tags (or “hotspots”) are the clickable points of the video that initially attract
viewers and allow them to interact with the video by opening overlays or clickouts.

DESCRIPTION:

This is a challenge exercise for WIREWAX where we test your HTML, CSS, Javascript and creative skills. Please read the rules and challenges goals. If you have any question, don't hesitate to email us. 
Fork the jsfiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/caL5Lwb7/1/) or create a github project and email us the url in the end of the exercise. 
Good luck :)
